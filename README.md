The Toy Language Interpreter is a software system designed to interpret and execute programs written in a simplified programming language. It's developed to aid in understanding the fundamental concepts of programming languages, including syntax, semantics, and program execution flow.
Key Features:

Syntax and Semantics: The interpreter defines a clear syntax and semantics for the Toy Language, providing a basic understanding of how programming languages are structured and interpreted.

Statement Execution: It supports various statements like variable declarations, arithmetic operations, conditional statements (if-else), loops, memory allocation, and parallel execution (using forks).

Data Types: The language supports basic data types such as integers, booleans, and references, enabling users to manipulate different types of data.

Memory Management: It manages memory allocation and deallocation through features like heap and reference types, allowing users to understand memory handling within a program.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project includes a graphical interface to visualize program execution, displaying program states, output, program counters, memory structures, and execution stacks.

Interactive Execution: Users can interact with the interpreter by selecting programs to run, executing programs step-by-step, inspecting program states, and visualizing the memory state during runtime.

Technologies Used:

JavaFX: The graphical user interface is developed using JavaFX to provide an interactive environment for users.
Java Programming: The core interpreter logic and program execution are implemented in Java, focusing on object-oriented programming principles.
Purpose:

Educational Tool: Primarily designed as an educational tool, it helps students and enthusiasts grasp the basics of programming language concepts, including interpreting code, memory management, and program execution.

Experimentation: It allows users to experiment with various program constructs, understand their behavior, and visualize how code execution flows within a program.
